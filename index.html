                            <h5>HTML & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</h5>
                            <p>Rogue Pickings is a fictitious food truck company serving fresh, healthy, green foods, daily. This website is a one-page design showcasing a very minimal, and suitably green aesthetic. Matching the colors from the PSD as perfectly as I could was my primary focus with this project.</p>

                            <h5>HTML5 & CSS Website</h5>
                            <p> This website is for a fictitious client, named Jubilee Austen, showcasing her portfolio of work. Working with a PSD and the help of Skillcrush course class direction, I coded the simple and elegant design of this website, and it is one of my favorites in terms of color combinations and layout thus far. </p>

                                <p>Unplugged was created for another fictitious client to practice coding my first responsive website, which I then used as a template for a follow up website, created for a real life client.</p>

                            <h5>HTML5 & CSS Exercise</h5>
                            <p>Holstee was a project that focussed heavily around the use of the "float" element and I had a lot of fun experimenting with different color and font combinations, in my effort to get certain quotes to stand out from the page more than others.</p>

                        <p>Coding websites is a very exciting and new venture for me. I started taking Skillcrush web development and design classes in early 2019 to upskill. I've always loved being able to express myself creatively, and this is the perfect line of work to build something from the ground up, and bring those creative ideas to life! <br><br> Can't wait to work with you!</p>
